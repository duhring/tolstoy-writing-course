# Embodied Narration: Writing with Tolstoy's Techniques

A web application for teaching high school students the art of "embodied narration" using Tolstoy's *War and Peace* as a model.

## Course Overview

Students will analyze vivid moments in *War and Peace* where Tolstoy uses physical cues (gesture, gait, facial expression, posture) to illuminate character and scene. Each week, students will observe, discuss, and practice these techniques in their own writing.

## Features

- **8-Week Course Structure**: Progressive lessons from introduction to synthesis
- **Interactive Analysis Tables**: Expandable/collapsible tables of Tolstoy's physical cues
- **Character Dossiers**: Dynamic profiles tracking physical motifs
- **Student Submissions**: Upload, comment, and peer review system
- **Export Functionality**: CSV/Sheets export of analytic tables and student work

## Technology Stack

- React 18 + TypeScript
- React Router for navigation
- Modern CSS3 responsive design
- Interactive components with state management

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
